# assignment-sirisha
Personal repo to submit assigments

## In case of fire, break glass...

Check out the `basics` repo where I'll accumulate helpful documents, such as what to do if you got stuck in vim.  ( https://github.com/seainfo6250/basics )

## Submission process 

**subject to change**

Clone this repo (`git clone https://github.com/seainfo6250/assignment-sirisha.git`)

For each assignment, do your work in a new branch (`git checkout -b YOURBRANCHNAME`)

Always remember to grab any changes since last time (`git pull origin master`)

For any assignment, modify the files in the proper subdirectory.

Use `git status` to see what's changed, and make sure you've used `git add FILENAME` on any new or changed files.  Tip: `git add .` will add everything in the current directory and below.

Don't forget to commit often - this only saves to your local clone, so you can commit as often as you like.  (`git commit -m"SOMEMESSAGE"`).  

When you're done, and everything has been added and committed, there are two steps left:

* Send your code to the repo:  `git push origin YOURBRANCHNAME`
* Go to the github site and start a pull request, to merge your branch into branch 'master'

I will be able to code review your changes line-by-line.  

If anything goes wrong, check `git status` or the error messages to get hints as to what to do.
