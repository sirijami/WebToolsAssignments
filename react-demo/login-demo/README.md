This is a demonstration of some basic service interactions.

The code is NOT quality - it's intended as a quick reference to get you past any blocks, not to provide code directly.
The code is NOT complete - it works, to do the most minimal demo of only some of the features, and that's all.

I've used many idiomatic and stylistic choices - you don't need to, and should not, copy these to your own code unless you happen to like one.  

You will need to `npm install` and modify the constants.js file.
