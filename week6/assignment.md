Create a version of your todo list app:

* copy the server.js from last time
* have a package.json ( npm init )and use 
* npm install --save express
* npm install --save eslint    (configure with eslint --init )
* run the linter!
* use arrow functions for your event bindings
* use only const and let, not var.   (prefer const over let!)
* use template literals, not Handlebars
* I want to use template literals for realz ( any produced strings should be generated from backtick strings with variable substitution)
* I do not want you to use the DOM as your source of truth
* Consider any ES6+ features that make your code more readable/maintainable
* On your own, run `node server.js` and make sure you can see your code at http://localhost:8000/todo.html
* Ask any questions needed to clean up commits and code base
